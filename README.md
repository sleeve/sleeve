### Hi there! 👋🏼

I go by **Steve** or **sleeve** and use **he/him** pronouns.

I'm a **Quality Engineer** advocating for the end users and helping craft pixel-perfect experiences that are fast, efficient, functional, stable, secure and accessible for everyone. I'm a hardware nerd who found a career in software but still loves them equally.  

Recently I've been geeking out on building a [Homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/), Docker, Linux, IoT/Home Automation, Python, [Small Form Factor PCs](https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/) and [Mechanical Keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/)!
