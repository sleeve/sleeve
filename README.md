### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I go by **Steve** or **sleeve** and use **he/him** pronouns.

I'm a **Quality Engineer** helping to craft pixel-perfect experiences that are fast, efficient, functional, stable, secure and accessible for everyone. I have a reputation for seeing the details that others overlook and I love learning new ways to get them fixed!

Recently I've been geeking out on building and configuring a [Homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/), Docker, Linux (Alpine and Arch btw ðŸ¤£), optimizing home network and IoT devices, Raspberry Pi, Python, [Small Form Factor PCs](https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/) and [Mechanical Keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/)! If there's a beta build of something I'm probably using it. ðŸ¥µ
