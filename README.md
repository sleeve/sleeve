### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ <img align="right" width="249" height="186" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sleeve/sleeve/master/images/bill_sick_jump.gif">

I go by **Steve** or **sleeve** and use **he/him** pronouns.

I'm a **Quality Engineer** advocating for the end users and helping craft pixel-perfect experiences that are fast, efficient, functional, stable, secure and accessible for everyone. I'm a **hardware** nerd who found a career in **software** but who still loves them both equally. I am blessed/cursed with an almost super-human instinct on how to crash apps, spot mis-aligned pixels and detect the slightest drops in performance.

Recently I've been geeking out on building and configuring a [Homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/), Docker, Linux (Alpine and Arch btw ðŸ¤£), optimizing home network and IoT devices, Raspberry Pi, Python, [Small Form Factor PCs](https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/) and [Mechanical Keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/)! If there's a beta build of anything I'm probably using it. ðŸ¤ª
