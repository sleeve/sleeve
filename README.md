### Hi there! 👋🏼

I go by **Steve** or **sleeve** and use **he/him** pronouns.

I'm a **Quality Engineer** advocating for the end users and helping craft pixel-perfect experiences that are fast, efficient, functional, stable, secure and accessible for everyone. I'm a hardware nerd who found a career in software but still loves playing with both. More recently I've been geeking out on [Homelabs](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/), Docker, Home Automation, Python, [Small Form Factor computers](https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/) and [mechanical keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/).
